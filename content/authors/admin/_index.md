Hello! I'm a PhD Candidate at Duke University in the sociology department. My primary research areas are social network analysis and adolescence. I use network analysis to study adolescent mental health and health-risk behaviors. Some specific areas I'm working on now are friendship stability, social status, network structure, and negative ties. I'm a research associate with the Duke Network Analysis Center and a doctoral student affiliate with the International Max Planck Research School for Population, Health, and Data Science (IMPRS-PHDS).
